Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my little experiment with C and HTTP protocols. I built this basic web server to dive deeper into C programming and get a feel for how HTTP works at a lower level. It's been a fun ride!
To get this running, just clone the repo and run `make`. Then fire it up with `./webserver`.You've got yourself a web server. 
Feel free to poke around the code, maybe add some more features, or just use it to learn.
